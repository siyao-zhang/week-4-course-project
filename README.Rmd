One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

An R script called run_analysis.R was created for the following purpose 

1.Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set - cbind()
2.Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement -grep(); select()
3.Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set - gsub(); tolower()
4.Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names - name()
5.From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject - group_by()
